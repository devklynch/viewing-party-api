        casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix),
        the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently
        portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger
        really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator
        is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient
        Roman Empire merely as the time setting.\r\nAll other aspects namely those
        gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the
        vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that
        successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and
        all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile.
        The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart.
        The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon.
        Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film
        director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big
        battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In
        the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial
        elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming
        techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed
        film about heroism and its true meaning.","created_at":"2012-07-13 07:25:20

        said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man''s skull with one hand.\r\n\r\nRidley
        Scott''s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest
        of fans, of which I''m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus
        in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are
        worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting
        favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it
        received.\r\n\r\nIn narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme,
        something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to
        my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony
        Mann''s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated
        by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing
        up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they
        did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.
        And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically
        swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator''s success is there for
        all to see.\r\n\r\nWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\r\n\r\nSo no originality
        in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there''s
        a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle
        to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally
        committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe''s Maximus is the
        man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the
        gamut of life''s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations,
        we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge
        splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the
        Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous
        year.\r\n\r\nBacking Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening
        villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen''s turn here
        against that of Diane Kruger''s in Troy to see the class difference for historical
        period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a
        spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb
        in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek
        Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus
        right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that''s inspiring.\r\n\r\nI
        didn''t know man could build such things.\r\n\r\nDialogue is literate and
        poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never
        at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and
        blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising
        clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator
        arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle
        of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the
        finale, the culmination of two men''s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott
        and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords
        and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously
        bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10","created_at":"2014-08-10

        has got just about everything from \"Spartacus\" (1960) to \"Decline and Fall
        of the Roman Empire\" (1964) via a bit of \"Quo Vadis\" (1951) to it - and
        Ridley Scott has managed to create a magnificent spectacle of a film. Russell
        Crowe is the eponymous soldier \"Maximus\". Commander of the Armies of the
        Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor
        - until, that is, the emperor''s son \"Commodus\" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his
        sister \"Lucilla\" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it''s
        all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make
        other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning
        \"Proximo\" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial
        nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting
        efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana
        all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics,
        betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie
        as \"Maximus\" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies
        into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day.
        Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the
        characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe
        and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power
        in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were
        a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from
        Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen
        that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in
        Hollywood.","created_at":"2023-04-18 10:41:47 UTC","id":"643e73ebc7176d04de98ad5d","updated_at":"2023-04-18

        directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2000, is undeniably one of the best
        movies ever made. A cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly blends action,
        drama, and history, this film leaves an indelible mark on all who watch it.\r\n\r\nAt
        the heart of \"Gladiator\" are the remarkable performances by Russell Crowe
        and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe''s portrayal of Maximus Decimus Meridius is nothing
        short of breathtaking. His stoic determination, unwavering loyalty, and charismatic
        presence make him the perfect embodiment of a hero. Joaquin Phoenix, on the
        other hand, delivers a chillingly convincing performance as the treacherous
        Commodus. His portrayal of the power-hungry and morally bankrupt emperor is
        both mesmerizing and repulsive, showcasing his exceptional acting prowess.\r\n\r\nWhat
        sets \"Gladiator\" apart from other films is its ability to evoke genuine
        emotions. The story of Maximus, a loyal general who seeks revenge for the
        murder of his family and the betrayal of his emperor, touches the very core
        of our humanity. The film explores themes of honor, justice, and the indomitable
        spirit of the human soul, making it a truly timeless narrative.\r\n\r\nI would
        rewatch it anytime and recommend it to anyone. It''s a solid 10/10, truly
